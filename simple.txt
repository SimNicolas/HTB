So this is the full text of the encryption. Seems to be an essay/ sentences that
might spell out instructions. It has commas and periods laid out.

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz

By what I'm reading I'm trying to decipher what each letter can mean by it's
common use in the sentences. Common words are alp (probably "THE" because first
word used in the sentence?), (h, o, and l are used for a 1 word) This sort of 
confuses me.

I.C. = 0.04428
Character Count = 446
This is a straight english alphabet cipher.
May be or may not be transposition
Possibles:Vigenere, Porta, Beaufort, Gronsfeld
Probably not: Substitution cipher

I tried transposition cipher solvers and got nothing.
I then quite literally shocked myself.
https://www.guballa.de/vigenere-solver solved it for me.

the vigenere cipher, was invented by a frenchman, blaise de vigenere 
in the 16th century. it is a polyalphabetic cipher because it uses two 
or more cipher alphabets to encrypt the data. in other words, the letters 
in the vigenere cipher are shifted by different amounts, normally done 
using a word or phrase as the encryption key . unlike the monoalphabetic 
ciphers, polyalphabetic ciphers are not susceptible to frequency 
analysis, as more than one letter in the plaintext can be represented 
by a single letter in the encryption. the key is the flag.
