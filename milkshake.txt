07. Kelis - Milkshake

Black Screen
41 seconds.

First time doing anything stego
I remember doing something similar to this in an example or lab in the earlier weeks
Hiding something within an mp3. I think it was just an example from a lecturer though

So the song is based off the popular song milkshake by Kelis
Rings at :41 and clip is :41 seconds long

looking at kali linux tools I've found a wayto hide data by steganographic techniques.
Using steghide you can hide a txt in a file (png or mp3 I'm assuming)

I tried changing the file extension to raw, png and can't open the file
image viewer can't open an mp3

Looking at the forums on hack the box, seems like this has to do with the waves of
the files (audio analysis, analyze the rainbow in the sky, go in direction of visual)

Also said sonic visualizer was a tool that could help

I found a youtube video named how to hide secret text in sound file wav using
sonic visualizer and it shows the music waves, but that didn't help that much

I watched another youtube video called Hide Secret Messages In Audio using 
sonic visualizer.

I went to layer -> add spectrogram
